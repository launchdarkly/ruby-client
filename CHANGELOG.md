# Change log

All notable changes to the LaunchDarkly Ruby SDK will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## [3.0.3] - 2018-03-23
## Fixed
- In the Redis feature store, fixed a synchronization problem that could cause a feature flag update to be missed if several of them happened in rapid succession.

## [3.0.2] - 2018-03-06
## Fixed
- Improved efficiency of logging by not constructing messages that won't be visible at the current log level. (Thanks, [julik](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-client/pull/98)!)


## [3.0.1] - 2018-02-26
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that could prevent very large feature flags from being updated in streaming mode.


## [3.0.0] - 2018-02-22
### Added
- Support for a new LaunchDarkly feature: reusable user segments.

### Changed
- The feature store interface has been changed to support user segment data as well as feature flags. Existing code that uses `InMemoryFeatureStore` or `RedisFeatureStore` should work as before, but custom feature store implementations will need to be updated.


## [2.5.0] - 2018-02-12

## Added
- Adds support for a future LaunchDarkly feature, coming soon: semantic version user attributes.

## Changed
- It is now possible to compute rollouts based on an integer attribute of a user, not just a string attribute.

## [2.4.1] - 2018-01-23
## Changed
- Reduce logging level for missing flags
- Relax json and faraday dependencies
## Fixed
- Wrap redis bulk updates in a transaction
- Fixed documentation links

## [2.4.0] - 2018-01-12
## Changed
- Will use feature store if already initialized even if connection to service could not be established.  This is useful when flags have been initialized in redis.
- Increase default and  minimum polling interval to 30s
- Strip out unknown top-level attributes

## [2.3.2] - 2017-12-02

### Fixed
- Make sure redis store initializations are atomic


## [2.3.1] - 2017-11-16

### Changed
- Include source code for changes described in 2.3.0


## [2.3.0] - 2017-11-16
## Added
- Add `close` method to Ruby client to stop processing events
- Add support for Redis feature store
- Add support for LDD mode
- Allow user to disable outgoing event stream.

## Changed
- Stop retrying on 401 responses (due to bad sdk keys)

## [2.2.7] - 2017-07-26
## Changed
- Update Readme to fix instructions on installing gem using command line
- Cleaned up formatting on various files (Rubocop)
## [2.2.5] - 2017-05-08
## Changed
- Added proxy support to streaming and http connections. Respects `HTTP_PROXY` and `http_proxy` environment variables as well as the `:proxy => protocol://user:pass@host` configuration parameter.

## [2.1.5] - 2017-03-28
## Changed
- Updated changelog 

## [2.1.1] - 2017-03-28
## Changed
- Bumped nio4r to 2.0

## [2.0.6] - 2017-02-10
## Changed
- Improved handling of http status codes that may not be integers.

## [2.0.5] - 2017-01-31
## Changed
- Improved error handling when connected to flag update stream.

## [2.0.3] - 2016-10-21
## Fixed
- Indirect stream events are now correctly processed

## [2.0.2] - 2016-08-08
## Changed
- The default logger now logs at `info` level

## [2.0.0] - 2016-08-08
### Added
- Support for multivariate feature flags. In addition to booleans, feature flags can now return numbers, strings, dictionaries, or arrays via the `variation` method.
- New `all_flags` method returns all flag values for a specified user.
- If streaming is disabled, the client polls for feature flag changes. If streaming is disabled, the client will default to polling LaunchDarkly every second for updates. The poll interval is configurable via `poll_interval`.
- New `secure_mode_hash` function computes a hash suitable for the new LaunchDarkly JavaScript client's secure mode feature.
- Support for extremely large feature flags. When a large feature flag changes, the stream will include a directive to fetch the updated flag.

### Changed
- You can now initialize the LaunchDarkly client with an optional timeout (specified in seconds). This will block initialization until the client has finished bootstrapping and is able to serve feature flags.
- The streaming implementation (`StreamProcessor`) uses [Celluloid](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid) under the hood instead of [EventMachine](https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine). The dependency on EventMachine has been removed.
- The `store` option has been renamed to `cache_store`.
- Offline mode can no longer be set dynamically. Instead, at configuration time, the `offline` parameter can be set to put the client in offline mode. It is no longer possible to dynamically change whether the client is online and offline (via `set_online` and `set_offline`). Call `offline?` to determine whether or not the client is offline.
- The `debug_stream` configuration option has been removed.
- The `log_timings` configuration option has been removed.

### Deprecated
- The `toggle` call has been deprecated in favor of `variation`.

### Removed
- `update_user_flag_setting` has been removed. To change user settings, use the LaunchDarkly REST API.
